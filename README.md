# A beautiful Spiro bug

Hey,
I tried to code a spirograph using OpenGL in CPP and made a slight mistake in the equation, but the result was beautiful.
It takes the inner radius, outer radius, and the distance of the (virtual) hole from the inner radius as input gives different graphs.
The code goes into an infinite loop, and the way the figure forms is a good watch.
It's chaotic in the beginning and slowly orders itself as the program progresses.

Sometime you may end up with nothing, it all depends on your inputs.

There are two cpp programs and an example video and image.
The video is the output obtained from following input:

- Outer Radius = 81
- Inner Radius = 69
- Distance of hole = 13

Additional info will be added soon
